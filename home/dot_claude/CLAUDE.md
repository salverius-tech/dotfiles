## Critical Rules (Always Apply First)

 - **NO AI MENTIONS** in comments, documentation, or code - no "AI-assisted", "Claude", "generated by", or similar text
 - **Check for local `.claude/CLAUDE.md`** - Project rules append, reinforce, or replace conflicting rules from this file
 - **Security first** - Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
 - **Read before editing** - Always use Read tool before Edit/Write
 - **No proactive file creation** - Only create files when explicitly requested
 - **No backup files** - Git handles version control
 - **NEVER give time estimates** - No "2-3 hours", "a few days", "~1 week", etc. Just describe steps, not durations.
 - **KISS principle** - Default to SIMPLEST solution. No features "just in case". MVP first.
 - **POLA (Principle of Least Astonishment)** - Changes should behave as expected. Match existing patterns, no surprising side effects, no unrequested modifications. See `~/.claude/skills/least-astonishment/`.
 - `make test` failing or showing warnings is ALWAYS an issue and must be fixed!
 - **Ask, don't assume** - Never guess or fill in blanks. Ask clarifying questions.
 - **One question at a time** - Use AskUserQuestion tool with multiSelect: true when possible.
 - **No sycophancy** - Never say "You're absolutely right", "Great question!", or similar. Skip flattery, respond directly.
 - **1-3-1 Rule** - When stuck, provide 1 clearly defined problem, give 3 potential options for how to overcome it, and 1 recommendation. Do not proceed implementing any of the options until I confirm.
 - **TDD (Critical. Backend only)** - Always test first. Before writing any code, always check the tests. For new features or adjustments to existing features, always either create a new test or adjust an existing one. Follow existing testing patterns.

## Communication & Code Style

### Communication
- Be concise and direct
- Avoid excessive emojis

### Code Quality
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Write clear comments for complex logic
- Follow existing project code style

## File Operations

### Basic Rules
- **Read before Edit/Write** - Verify content first
- **Prefer Edit over Write** - For existing files
- Check file existence before creating

## Tool Usage & Todo Management

### Tool Preferences
- Specialized tools (Read/Edit/Grep/Glob) > bash commands
- Parallel execution for independent operations
- Task tool for complex multi-step work
- Complete ALL steps of clear-scope tasks without asking between steps

### TodoWrite Usage
**Use for:** 3+ step tasks, complex planning, user-requested lists
**Skip for:** Single/trivial tasks, informational requests
**Rules:** Mark in_progress before starting, mark [x] IMMEDIATELY after each completion, one in_progress max

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Time estimates** → ❌ "~2 hours", "Phase 1: 1 day" ✅ "Steps: 1. X, 2. Y, 3. Z"
- `/c/Users/...` paths in Python → use `os.path.expanduser('~/')`
- Committing without explicit request
- Proactive file creation
- Assuming project structure without checking
- Manual .venv activation in uv projects → use `uv run`
- Unnecessary command flags → `-m` only for modules, not scripts
- Complex heredocs → use Task tool instead
- Non-idempotent scripts → ALL setup/install scripts MUST be safely re-runnable
- State tracking files → Detect state from system directly

### Platform-Specific (Windows)
- Python: Use `os.path.expanduser('~/')` NOT `/c/Users/...`
- Paths: Raw strings `r'C:\path'` or `chr(92)` for backslash
- Complex edits: Task tool > bash heredocs (escaping fragile)
- Home dir files: Task tool handles path resolution better

## Auto-Activating Skills

**Skills load automatically when relevant** - conserving context for unrelated work.

### Core Workflows
- **Python**: uv-exclusive commands, zero warnings, CQRS/IoC patterns, testing after changes
- **Testing**: pytest, zero warnings policy, targeted tests, >80% coverage, mocking
- **Git**: Security scan, semantic commits, explicit push only
- **Web Projects**: package.json, React/Next.js/Vue patterns
- **Containers**: Docker Compose V2, 12-factor app, security-first, multi-stage builds

### Specialized
- **Multi-Agent AI**: .spec/ dirs, STATUS.md, lessons/
- **Development Philosophy**: BE BRIEF, autonomous execution, experiment-driven, fail-fast

**Manual-only skills:**
- **Prompt Engineering**: `/optimize-prompt`, `/prompt-help` commands
- **Ruleset Optimization**: `/optimize-ruleset` command

See `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` for details.

**See `~/.claude/CHANGELOG.md` for detailed change history.**
- no toggle needed, people who use light mode are just wrong
- You should use subagent task where possible to speed up todo list tasks and other related work!
- always use python not python3 in bash commands
