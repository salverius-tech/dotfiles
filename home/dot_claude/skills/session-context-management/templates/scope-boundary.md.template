# Scope Boundary Framework

{BASE_TARGET}

## Phase 1: Core Requirement

**Exact problem being solved:**
{DEFINE_PROBLEM_STATEMENT}

**Success criteria:**
- {SUCCESS_CRITERION_1}
- {SUCCESS_CRITERION_2}
- {SUCCESS_CRITERION_3}

**Who is requesting this and why?**
{REQUESTER_AND_RATIONALE}

## Phase 2: Explicit In-Scope

**Minimum viable changes required:**
- {CHANGE_1}
- {CHANGE_2}
- {CHANGE_3}

**Files that must be modified:**
- {FILE_1}
- {FILE_2}
- {FILE_3}

**Tests that must pass:**
- {TEST_1}
- {TEST_2}
- {TEST_3}

**Documentation that must update:**
- {DOC_1}
- {DOC_2}

## Phase 3: Explicit Out-of-Scope

**Tempting improvements to defer:**
- {TEMPTING_ITEM_1}
- {TEMPTING_ITEM_2}

**Related but separate concerns:**
- {RELATED_ITEM_1}
- {RELATED_ITEM_2}

**Nice-to-have features:**
- {FEATURE_1}
- {FEATURE_2}

**Speculative abstractions:**
- {SPECULATION_1}
- {SPECULATION_2}

**Performance optimizations (unless proven bottleneck):**
- {OPTIMIZATION_1}
- {OPTIMIZATION_2}

## Phase 4: Boundary Justification

**Why out-of-scope items are excluded:**
- {ITEM}: {JUSTIFICATION}
- {ITEM}: {JUSTIFICATION}

**Evidence needed to bring items in-scope:**
- To include {ITEM}: {EVIDENCE_REQUIRED}
- To include {ITEM}: {EVIDENCE_REQUIRED}

**Follow-up tasks for deferred work:**
- [ ] {FOLLOWUP_1}
- [ ] {FOLLOWUP_2}
- [ ] {FOLLOWUP_3}

## Phase 5: Scope Verification

- [ ] Does this solve the stated problem?
- [ ] Are all changes justified by requirements?
- [ ] Can anything be removed?
- [ ] Are we building the MVP or the dream version?
